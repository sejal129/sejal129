## Hola Amigo👋

This is Sejal Choudhary. I am a Programmer, and always excited to learn new stuffs. 
```
Programmer (noun): A machine that turns coffee into code.
```
- 🏢 I am currently working at HSBC.
- :computer: I code in Java as well as in Python.
- 💬 Ask me about anything. If I didn't know maybe I will learn something new!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I talk a lot. I tend to slip deep "gyaan" into the conversation.
