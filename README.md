## Hola AmigoðŸ‘‹

I am Sejal Choudhary, a Computer Science and Engineering Undergrad at Banasthali Vidyapith :student:. I am a Programmer, and always excited to learn new stuffs.

def 4YearsOfCSE(self):
    year = 0
    prevWorkDone = 0
    while(year<4):
        workDone = int(input())
        if workDone>prevWorkDone:
           print("Keep it Up!")
        else:
           print("Real programmer starts from 0.")
        prevWorkDone = workDone
